-Kernel Module that interfaces with Virtual Memory System and redirects page
faults on a specific memory area of a process to a remote process via the
network.

-Modify linux kernel so networked memory can be mapped to a given process.
(hint: look at mmap() system call)

-idea is to store pages on the network, filling the tlb with new page
pointers.

-when the process writes to the particular region, code can flush the new data
across the network when sync is requested.

-hint: use user-level network API instead of kernel ones.


Use the Client-Server Model approach:
-Communications between clients and servers is done by message passing.
